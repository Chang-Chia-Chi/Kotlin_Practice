# DynaCache - Progress Log

One entry per ticket, appended when the ticket is done. Later sessions read this to learn
what already exists and which deviations override the spec.

## Entry template

```
## T<nn>: <ticket title>

**Built:** what exists now that did not before.
**Concepts named:** the domain vocabulary this ticket introduced, and where the seams went.
**Acceptance:** each checkbox from the ticket, with the test that proves it.
**Deviations:** every place the code differs from the spec or plan, and why. "None" if none.
**For the next ticket:** seams left stubbed, gotchas, anything surprising.
```

A deviation recorded here overrides the spec for the code that already exists. A deviation
that is merely a shortcut is debt: say so, and say what would repay it. Decisions that change
a fixed contract are numbered `D<n>` starting at D1 and referenced from the spec.
