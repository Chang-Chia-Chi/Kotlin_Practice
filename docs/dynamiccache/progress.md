# DynaCache - Progress Log

One entry per ticket, appended when the ticket is done. Later sessions read this to learn
what already exists and which deviations override the spec.

## Entry template

```
## T<nn>: <ticket title>

**Built:** what exists now that did not before.
**Concepts named:** the domain vocabulary this ticket introduced, and where the seams went.
**Acceptance:** each checkbox from the ticket, with the test that proves it.
**Deviations:** every place the code differs from the spec or plan, and why. "None" if none.
**For the next ticket:** seams left stubbed, gotchas, anything surprising.
```

A deviation recorded here overrides the spec for the code that already exists. A deviation
that is merely a shortcut is debt: say so, and say what would repay it. Decisions that change
a fixed contract are numbered `D<n>` starting at D1 and referenced from the spec.

## T01: Skeleton, frozen reply model, test tooling

**Built:** The four poms drop AssertJ and gain `org.mockito:mockito-core` 5.14.2 in test scope
next to JUnit 5.11 (managed in the parent, declared in all three modules). `dynacache-engine`
gains its first code, kotlin-stdlib only: `Reply` (`Simple`, `Error(kind, message)`, `Integer`,
`Bulk(bytes?)`, `Array`), `Key`, `PartitionId`, `Command` with `Ping`, and the `CommandEngine`
interface with its `ApEngine` stub. Sixteen tests: fourteen in the engine, one apiece in cluster
and server so every module's surefire runs.

**Concepts named:** `Reply` is the only result type, byte-content-equal down through nested
arrays, so a test writes the reply it expects as a literal. `Key` is binary-safe and equal by
bytes; it exposes `hashedBytes` (the hash tag when the key has one, the whole key otherwise) and
a non-negative `hash` over those bytes. That split is deliberate: two keys sharing a tag are
different keys that hash alike, which is what makes a batch on `{user1}.a` and `{user1}.b` legal
(C12). `hashedBytes` is what the ring will hash in T17, so the hash-tag rule lives in one place
for both layers. Seams: `CommandEngine` (`submit`, `atomically(keys) { ctx -> R }`, `close`) with
`PartitionContext.execute` as the batch's inner handle, exactly plan 2.3; the single adapter
`ApEngine` is a stub. `PartitionId` wraps an index; `Command` is a sealed root with `Ping` only.

**Acceptance:**
- `mvn package` green from `DynaCache/`, one passing test per module: engine 14, cluster 1,
  server 1.
- No pom mentions AssertJ (`grep -ri assertj` over poms and sources is empty); `mvn
  dependency:tree` shows `mockito-core:5.14.2:test` in all three modules.
- `Reply.Bulk(null)` and `Reply.Bulk(bytes)` compare by content, and so do bulks nested in an
  `Array`: `bulk replies compare by byte content, not by array identity`, `a nil bulk equals only
  another nil bulk`, `an array compares by its items, bulk bytes included`. `Key` equality is by
  bytes including non-UTF-8 ones: `keys compare by their bytes and are binary-safe`.
- Hash-tag rule: `a hash tag makes only the tag decide the hash`, `a key without a hash tag
  hashes whole`, `an empty or unclosed tag falls back to the whole key`, `the first tag wins and
  only its first closing brace ends it`.
- `CommandEngine.submit` and `atomically` exist with plan 2.3's shapes and throw
  `NotImplementedError`: `submit is a stub until the partition executors arrive`, `atomically is
  a stub until the partition executors arrive`.
- This entry.

**Deviations:** None against the ticket or plan 2.3. Three judgement calls worth recording:
`ApEngine.close()` is a no-op rather than a stub, because there is nothing to shut down yet and
a throwing `close()` would be a trap for T02's tests; `CommandEngine` does not extend
`AutoCloseable`, since nothing needs it yet; `Key.hash` is a 31-multiplier hash over
`hashedBytes` masked non-negative, not SHA-256, because it buckets keys into local partitions
only. Spec 3 puts SHA-256 on the ring, and T17 should hash `hashedBytes` with it there.

**For the next ticket:** T02 owns `ApEngine`'s constructor (partition count, injected `Clock`),
the executors and the store; `submit` and `atomically` are the only stubs, and `Command` gains a
variant per ticket. `Key` holds the array it is given rather than copying it, so nothing may
mutate a key's bytes after construction; `hashedBytes` copies on each read, which is fine at
today's call rate and worth caching if a profile ever says otherwise. Partition selection should
be `key.hash % partitionCount` directly, since `hash` is already non-negative.

## T17: Hash ring and preference lists

**Built:** `dynacache-cluster` gains its first code, `dynacache.cluster.Ring`. `NodeId` is a
value class over a node's name, comparable by that name. `Ring.of(nodes, vnodesPerNode = 128)`
builds the ring from a node set and a vnode count and nothing else: each node contributes
`vnodesPerNode` vnodes at 63 bits of SHA-256 over `"<node>#<vnode index>"`, sorted clockwise
with ties broken by owner then index. `positionOf(key)` is 63 bits of SHA-256 over
`Key.hashedBytes`. `preferenceList(key, n)` binary-searches the key's successor vnode and walks
clockwise collecting distinct owners; `vnodeOf(key)` returns that successor vnode. `Vnode` is
`(owner, index, position, rangeStart)` with `holds(position)` for the half-open range
`(rangeStart, position]`, wrapping at the top of the ring.

**Concepts named:** The ticket's words are the code's words. **Vnode**, **preference list** and
**coordinator** (the first entry of the list) come straight from CONTEXT.md, and no method or
field mentions a partition: the ring decides placement and the engine's partition executor is a
separate layer it never reaches (ADR 0001). The hash-tag rule lives once, in the engine:
the ring hashes `Key.hashedBytes`, so `{user1}.a` and `{user1}.b` share a position, a vnode and
a preference list without the cluster module knowing the brace rule at all. `Vnode` carries its
range because the range, not the position, is what T27's Merkle trees and T28's anti-entropy
compare; `Ring.vnodes` is public for the same reason. Ring positions are 63-bit non-negative
`Long`s, the same masking trick `Key.hash` uses, so ordering is plain signed comparison and no
unsigned arithmetic appears anywhere.

**Acceptance:**
- `C3_preference_list_has_n_distinct_nodes`: three nodes, a preference list of 3 has 3 entries,
  3 distinct entries, and is exactly the node set.
- `a preference list longer than the node set is refused`: `preferenceList(key, 4)` on a
  three-node ring throws `IllegalArgumentException`.
- `I5_same_inputs_same_ring`: a ring built from the node set and one built from the same set in
  reverse iteration order have the same node list and the same preference lists for 200 keys.
- `ring_determinism`: three independently built rings give identical preference lists for
  10,000 seeded keys.
- `ring_hash_tag_places_keys_together`: `{user1}.a` and `{user1}.b` share both a position and a
  preference list.
- `ring_load_is_even`: 100,000 seeded keys over three nodes, coordinator load max over min below
  1.25 at the default 128 vnodes per node, with no bump needed.
- `a key belongs to the vnode whose range holds its position` and `the vnode ranges tile the
  ring end to end`: 1,000 keys land in a vnode that holds them and whose owner is the
  coordinator; consecutive ranges abut and the first wraps onto the last.
- `mvn clean package` green: engine 14, cluster 9, server 1.
- This entry.

**Deviations:** None against the ticket, the plan entry or spec 2.4. Three judgement calls worth
recording. `Ring.of` takes a plain `Set<NodeId>` and sorts it itself rather than requiring a
`SortedSet`, so I5 holds no matter what order a caller's set iterates in, which the test asserts
directly. A position is the first 8 bytes of the SHA-256 digest masked to 63 bits rather than the
full 256-bit digest as a `BigInteger`; 384 points in a 2^63 space collide with negligible
probability, and the sort's owner-then-index tie-break keeps the ring deterministic even if two
ever did. `Ring.of` rejects a vnode count below 128 rather than silently raising it, because spec
2.4's floor is a contract and a caller asking for 16 has misread it.

**For the next ticket:** T18 wires one `Ring` per node in `InProcessCluster` and can share a
single instance across all three, since the ring is immutable and a pure function of its inputs.
`preferenceList` is the coordinator lookup T19's router needs: element 0 is the coordinator, and
the full list of N is what T22's quorum writes to. `vnodeOf(key)` and the public `Ring.vnodes`
are the ranges T27 and T28 build Merkle trees over; `Vnode.holds(position)` already handles the
wrapping range, so anti-entropy does not need to special-case the top of the ring. Membership
changes are out of scope here and stay so: a new node set means a new `Ring`, and dynamic
rebalancing is on the do-not-build list.
